Git helps to collaborate between developers.
It tracks the change without removing the history.
Git is the best version control.
Learning git is easy and fun, sometimes complex to solve problems in branching too.

To create nw file from cmd in a folder with git touch command is used.
     Set-Alias -Name touch -Value New-Item 
and after this line simply adding   touch fileName   will add new file
fileName means the name of file(can be anything eg, HTML/CSS/Js/txt,README.md)
